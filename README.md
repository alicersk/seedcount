# seedcount
Seedcount will serve as a design tool for Mid-Atlantic Native seed mix design for establishing novel habitat, for example, pollinator or grassland bird habitat. It will help designers visualize their design through the plotting function, and produce a seed mix with percentages by weight from inputted species and desired plant densities (in meters squared).
### In Development

See below for instructions on how to install the code to expand it.

```
conda install pandas numpy altair streamlit -c conda-forge 

git clone https://github.com/alicersk/seedcount
cd ./seedcount/src
streamlit run app.py
```
Once the streamlit app has launched, select some plant species to get started.

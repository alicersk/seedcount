# seedcount
Seedcount is a design tool for Mid-Atlantic seed mix design for establishing novel habitat, for example, pollinator or grassland bird habitat. It will help designers visualize their design through the plotting function, and produce a seed mix with percentages by weight from inputted species and desired plant densities (in square yards).
### In Development

See below for instructions on how to install the code to expand it.

```
conda install pandas numpy altair streamlit -c conda-forge 

git clone https://github.com/alicersk/seedcount
cd ./seedcount
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
Once the streamlit app has launched, select some plant species to get started. 

If you want to use the app in its current iteration, rather than work on the code, simply go to the following url:
